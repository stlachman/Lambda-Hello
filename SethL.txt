Hello, my name is Seth Lachman!

Three words that describe me: curious, passionate, and diligent.

I really enjoy brewing and talking about coffee. It's amazing to me how there are so many variables that impact the flavor of the coffee you drink each day. From the time the coffee berry is picked until you brew it thousands of miles from its origin.
